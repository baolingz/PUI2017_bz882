Assignment Preparation:

1. I work on this homework individually. I requested a API key to the real-time bus data from MTA through the MTA Bus Time interface.

Assignment 1: Tracking each vehicle for a line

1. I wrote a Python script named as show_bus_locations_bz882.py to retrieve and report information about the real-time coordinates of each bus for a given bus line. 
2. A sample terminal command: python show_bus_locations.py <MTA_KEY> <BUS_Line>
3. The Program will return the following output:\
   1)the bus name,\
   2)the number of vehicles\
   3)their current position

Assignment 2:Next Stop Information

1. I wrote a Python script named as get_bus_info_bz882.py that displays informaiton on the next stop location of all busses of a given line. For example, whether the bus is  approching a stop ,or is 1 stop away from it.
2. A sample terminal command: python get_bus_info.py <MTA_KEY> <BUS_Line>
3. The Program will output to a CSV file named as <BUS_Line>.csv and return the following outputs:\
   1)Latitude\
   2)Longitude\
   3)Stop Name\
   4)Stop Status

Assignment 3: Read CSV files with pandas

1. I wrote a Jupyter Notebook on compute
2. I used the environmental variable DFDATA to access a dataset with at least 2 numerical value columns, which is located in CUSP data hub
3. I used pandas to read in the CSV file from the DF into a pandas dataframe
4. I created a new dataframe which contains only the 2 numberical values columns I selected
5. I Plot the Columns one against the other in a scatter plot.

Extra Credit Assignment: Work with dates in Pandas

1. I repeat the steps in Assignment 3 with a CSV file that contains a date/time and a numberical value. 
2. I Plot the numbercial value against the date/time.
