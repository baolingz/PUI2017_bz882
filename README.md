# PUI2017_bz882
**Set up your environment:**
1.I created a file named PUI2017 on my desktop
2.I open my bash_file and created an environmental variable named PUI2017. I assigned the directory path to this variable
3.I assigned command "cd $PUI2017" to the alias pui2017, so that I would be able to go to the directory of PUI2017 by directly execute pui2017
4.I executed "echo $PUI2017" and it returns the full path to the directory.
5.I executed "pui2017" and it took me to the directory of PUI2017

The following attachments are the screenshots of my env.variable setup commands and my .bashrc/.bash_profile file.
