Formulate the Null hypothesis in words and in formulae for the 4 experiments below:

1. Do diets help lose more fat than the exercise?

<b>Null</b>: The average % of fat lost by people in the test sample (who on diets and exercise) is greater than or equal to the one by the people in the \
control sample (who only excercise)
Bts >= Bcs

Experimental setup: you have a test and a control sample.

2. Quantify the danger of smoking for pregnant women. (Olds et al., 1994, p. 223)

<b>Null</b>: the average IQ of children at age 1, 2, 3, 4 of smokers during pregnency is equal to the one of children of non-smokers.
IQs = IQns
Experimemtal setup: measure IQ of children of smokers and non-smokers at age 1, 2, 3, and 4 years.


3. Food deserts contribute to the incidence of diabetes Food deserts are defined as parts of the country vapid of fresh fruit,\
vegetables, and other healthful whole foods, usually found in impoverished areas. This is largely due to a lack of grocery stores, farmers' markets, and healthy food providers.

<b>Null</b>: 

This is not a lab experiment, but you have data on the incidence of diabetes for the US population.
