t-test	| 1, listen or not listen to happy music duirng the task  | categorical | 1. Overall divergent thinking score| continious ratio | 2, gender, age | categorical, continuous | Is creativity higher for participants who listened to ‘happy music’ (i.e., classical music high on arousal and positive mood) while performing the divergent creativity task, than for participants who performed the task in silence.  | overall divergent thinking score test group <= overall divergent thinking score control group |0.0083| [Happy creativity: Listening to happy music facilitates divergent thinking](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0182210) |
