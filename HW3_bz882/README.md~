HW3_Assignment 1 and 3. I finished the homework individually.

HW3_Assignment 2 CitiBike

I work with Marium Sultan. She thought of the idea and generated the hypothesis formulas. I labeled all the observations with 'daytime rider' or 'nighttime rider' by using the 'time_checker' function I created. We worked on the ploting collabratively by refering to the the sample code written by Professor Bianco.

Besides, we are using different Citibike datasets. Mine is from 201501 and Marium's is from 201707 but we were using the same methodology and syntax.

Assignment 1: Write an ipython notebook that demonstrates visually in a data-driven way the Central Limit Theorem.

1) Plot Chi-square distribution, Normal distribution, Poisson distribution, Binomial distribution, and Non-Binomial distribution.
2) Plot the distribution of 100 sample means for each distribution.
3) Fit a gaussian to the distribution of means (together for all distributions).

Assignment 2: Set up the work for data-driven inference based on CitiBike data.

1) Form a hypothesis and assign a significance level.
2) Store the data in PUIDATA and read the data.
    Plot the number of trips, separate Subscriber from Customer.
    Add the std in the figure.
    Normalize the distribution of trips.

Assignment 3: Finish z-test lab and turn it in as a notebook.

    Form a hypothesis and assign a significance level.
    Store the data in PUIDATA and read the data.
    Calculating the Z-statistic.
    Draw a conclusion based on the result.
