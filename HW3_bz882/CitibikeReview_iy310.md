Hi Pauline!

## A. Hypothesis
Null hypothesis: The ratio of men biking during nighttime (7pm - 5am) over man biking during daytime (5am - 7pm) is lower than the ratio of women biking during nighttime over daytime.
Alternative hypothesis: The ratio of men biking during night time over daytime is greater than that the ratio of women biking during night time over daytime.

The null and alternative hypotheses are both correctly formulated. Although shown in the H0, H1 equations, I would just add the 'equal to' part in the text-descriptiive null hypothesis that the ratio of men is less than OR EQUAL TO the ration of women.

## B. Data
The data has the approporiate variables of gender and time. They were both processed correctly to extract the needed values.
Excellent way of using a little function to sort through using the dt.datetime and assign the daytime nighttime taxonomies.

## C. Test
For the type of data that is being dealt here, I believe the most approporiate tests are the t test or Z test. Both are apt in comparing the means of the two groups ato show if there is a difference when approximately normally distributed. 
Although we have no access to the standard deviation valuation of the population, since the sample sizes are quite large, using the Z-test is still excellent for testing the difference of the means of the two samples. 

Good job!
