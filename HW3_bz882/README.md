HW3_Assignment 1 and 3. I finished the homework individually.

HW3_Assignment 2 CitiBike

I work with Marium Sultan. She thought of the idea and generated the hypothesis formulas. I labeled all the observations with 'daytime rider' or 'nighttime rider' by using the 'time_checker' function I created. We worked on the ploting collabratively by refering to the the sample code written by Professor Bianco.

Besides, we are using different Citibike datasets. Mine is from 201501 and Marium's is from 201707 but we were using the same methodology and syntax.

Assignment 1: Write an ipython notebook that demonstrates visually in a data-driven way the Central Limit Theorem.

1)Generate 100 samples of different sizes N (N>10 & N<2000) from each of 5 different distributions (500 samples in total), all with the same population mean
2) Plot Chi-square distribution, Normal distribution, Poisson distribution, Binomial distribution, and Non-Binomial distribution.
3) Plot the distribution of 100 sample means for each distribution.
4) Fit a gaussian to the distribution of means (together for all distributions).

Assignment 2: Set up the work for data-driven inference based on CitiBike data.

1) download citibike data from their website.
2) State the idea we want to test, and formulate the Null and Alternative hypothesis (specify the confidence level)
2) label all the observations with 'daytime rider' or 'nighttime ri\
der' by using the 'time_checker' function.
3) Plot the number of trips by riders' type(day or night) and gender
4) Normalize the distribution of trips. Plot the fraction of trips by nighttime  daytime riders; display them seperately by gender 

Assignment 3: Finish z-test lab and turn it in as a notebook.

1) complete the formula of the hypothesis (Null and Alternative) to be tested in words and formula
2) calculate of the z statistics (with the given formula and the data processed from the data file)
3) compare the statistis with the significance threshold and the conclusions about the Null Hypothesis
