HW3_Assignment 1 and 3. I finished the homework individually.

HW3_Assignment 2 CitiBike

I work with Marium Sultan. She thought of the idea and generated the hypothesis formulas. I labeled all the observations with 'daytime rider' or 'nighttime rider' by using the 'time_checker' function I created. We worked on the ploting collabratively by refering to the the sample code written by Professor Bianco.

Besides, we are using different Citibike datasets. Mine is from 201501 and Marium's is from 201707 but we were using the same methodology and syntax.
